Winter is coming, or so you think.

We've got plenty of games coming up in the next several months, but I don't see why Microsoft should stop selling some of it, especially when it comes to the Xbox One at launch.

This morning, it was reported that Microsoft had decided to give away one of its flagship games to a limited number of Xbox owners.

We've reached out to Microsoft for comment and are awaiting confirmation.
